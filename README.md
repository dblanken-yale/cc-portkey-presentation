**Presenter:** David Blankenship

**Note:** This was an internal presentation. The slides are included here for reference.

## About This Talk

AI coding tools are widely available, but using them without structure often leads to inconsistent results and decisions made on autopilot. This talk demonstrates a practical, repeatable workflow that keeps the developer in control while reducing time spent on repetitive tasks. Using Claude Code with Portkey as the backbone, the workflow is applied to a real GitHub issue — taken from requirements all the way to a merged pull request across four working sessions.

## What's Demonstrated

- Writing structured requirements documents (PRDs) before touching code
- Guiding implementation iteratively with context, feedback, and screenshots
- Committing at each logical step using conventional commits
- Generating PR descriptions and testing checklists with AI assistance
- Using Portkey for pay-as-you-go API access without usage limits or session cooldowns
